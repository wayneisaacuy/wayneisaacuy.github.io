Operator inference for partial observations to accompany the manuscript [Operator inference of non-Markovian terms for learning reduced models from partially observed state trajectories (arXiv:2103.01362
0)] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01362) by W.I.T. Uy and B. Peherstorfer. The code and data reproduce the numerical examples in the appendix in which we numerically compare the error between the Markovian reduced model and the reduced model with non-Markovian term.
